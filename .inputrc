# show-all-if-ambiguous
#     This alters the default behavior of the completion functions.
#     If set to On, words which have more than one possible completion cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell.
# match-hidden-files
#     This variable, when set to On, causes readline to match files whose names begin with a `.' (hidden files) when performing filename completion.
#     If set to Off, the leading `.' must be supplied by the user in the filename to be completed.
# mark-directories
#     If set to On, completed directory names have a slash appended.
# completion-prefix-display-length
#     The length in characters of the common prefix of a list of possible completions that is displayed without modification.
#     When set to a value greater than zero, common prefixes longer than this value are replaced with an ellipsis when displaying possible completions.
